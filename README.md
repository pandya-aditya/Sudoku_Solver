# Sudoku Solver in Python

## Overview

This project is a simple Sudoku solver implemented in Python. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle efficiently. The program reads a predefined Sudoku board from the script and outputs the solved board to the console.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking technique.
- **Console Output**: Displays both the original and solved puzzles in a readable format.
- **Simple Implementation**: Written in pure Python with no external dependencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

2. **Run the Script**

   To run the solver, execute the Python script:

   ```bash
   python Solver.py
   ```

   The program will display the original Sudoku board and the solved board in the console.

## How It Works

The script includes the following functions:

- `solve(board)`: Recursively solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- `show_board(board)`: Prints the Sudoku board in a human-readable format.
- `find_empty(board)`: Finds the next empty spot (marked as `0`) on the board.
- `check_valid(board, num, pos)`: Checks whether placing a number in a given position is valid according to Sudoku rules.

### Example Input

The initial Sudoku puzzle is hardcoded in the script:

```python
board = [
    [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [8, 0, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0]
]
```

### Example Output

When the script runs, it displays the original and solved Sudoku boards:

```
Original Sudoku Board:
0 2 0 | 5 0 6 | 0 8 0 
0 6 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0 
5 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 4 
-----------------------
7 0 0 | 0 0 8 | 9 0 2 
4 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 1 
8 0 2 | 9 0 0 | 0 0 3 
-----------------------
2 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 7 
0 0 0 | 0 5 0 | 0 1 0 
0 1 0 | 8 0 4 | 0 2 0 

Solved Sudoku Board:
1 2 3 | 5 4 6 | 7 8 9 
4 6 8 | 3 7 9 | 2 5 1 
5 9 7 | 2 8 1 | 6 3 4 
-----------------------
7 3 5 | 4 1 8 | 9 6 2 
4 8 9 | 6 2 3 | 5 7 1 
8 5 2 | 9 6 7 | 1 4 3 
-----------------------
2 4 6 | 1 9 5 | 3 8 7 
3 7 1 | 2 5 6 | 4 9 8 
9 1 5 | 8 3 4 | 7 2 6 
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Input**: Allow users to input their own Sudoku puzzles via command line or file input.
- **Graphical Interface**: Add a GUI to make the program more user-friendly.
- **Support for Larger Grids**: Extend the solver to handle larger or custom-sized Sudoku grids.
